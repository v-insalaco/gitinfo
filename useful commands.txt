2. Configure Git (if you haven't already)
Open a terminal (in VS Code or your system's terminal) and set up your user name and email address with Git, as these will be associated with your commits:

git init
and press Enter. This command creates a new Git repository in your project directory.
4. Add Your Project Files to the Repository
Still in the terminal, add your project files to the repository by running:

git add .
This command stages all your files for commit. If you want to add specific files, replace
.
with the file names.

Commit the added files to your repository:

git commit -m "Initial commit"
5. Create a New Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub.com and log in.
Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository."
Name your repository, add a description (optional), and choose whether the repository will be public or private.
Click "Create repository."
6. Link Your Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the new repository on GitHub, you'll be taken to a page with a quick setup section including a URL. Copy that URL.

Back in the VS Code terminal, link your local repository to GitHub with:

git remote add origin YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
Replace
YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
with the URL you just copied from GitHub.

7. Push Your Code to GitHub
Now, push your code from your local repository to GitHub with:

git push -u origin master

8. Sync Future Changes
Stage the changes:
git add .
(or specific files)
Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Description of changes"
Push the changes to GitHub:
git push
